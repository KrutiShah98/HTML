    <h1> Importance of meta tag
        and Doctypes</h1>

        <p>The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

            <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
            
            
            Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
            
            There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta>
             tag</p>

        <h2>DOCTYPE Declaration  </h2>  
        <p>All HTML documents must start with a DOCTYPE declaration.

            The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.</p>
